# PyChess
**PyChess** is a chess application built on **Python** with the **PyGame** library.
It is designed to mirror the game of chess using a computer. This application does not differ from those available on popular chess websites, and the gameplay in it is simple and clear.
<br>

## Capabilities and implementations
### The results of my work that I have achieved and implemented in the application are below:

### Game logic
  - setting up the chessboard
  - moving pieces
  - knocking down opponent's pieces
  - turn-based gameplay
  - en passant
  - castling
  - checks
  - pawn promotion
  
### User facilities
  - proposed possible moves
  - making the last move visible
  
### Impressions of the game
  - changing the color palette of the chessboard (under 'c' key)
  - the sounds of the execution of the movement and the capture
  
### More opportunities coming soon
  - examples of use in the form of photos and others
  - castling improve
  - stalemate, draw and win scenarios
  - menu
  - LAN games
  - turn the script into an app
  - ...
