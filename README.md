# PyChess
PyChess is a chess application built on Python with the PyGame library. This application does not differ from those available on popular chess websites, and the gameplay in it is simple and clear.

## Capabilities and implementations
Below are the results of my work that I have achieved and implemented in the application:


### Game logic
  - setting up the chessboard
  - moving pawns
  - knocking down opponent's pawns
  - all kinds of chess rules like: Castling, En passant, Promotion, Checkmate, Mate, Stalemate...
  
### User facilities
  - proposed possible moves
  - making the last move visible
  
### Impressions of the game
  - changing the color palette of the chessboard
  - the sounds of the execution of the movement and the capture
  
### More opportunities coming soon
  - ...
