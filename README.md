# PyChess
**PyChess** is a chess application built on **Python** with the **PyGame** library.
It is designed to mirror the game of chess using a computer. This application does not differ from those available on popular chess websites, and the gameplay in it is simple and clear.
<br>

## Capabilities and implementations
### The results of my work that I have achieved and implemented in the application are below:

### Game logic
  - setting up the chessboard
  - moving pawns
  - knocking down opponent's pawns
  
  
### User facilities
  - proposed possible moves
  - making the last move visible
  
### Impressions of the game
  - changing the color palette of the chessboard
  - the sounds of the execution of the movement and the capture
  
### More opportunities coming soon
  - examples of use in the form of photos and others
  - all kinds of chess rules like: Castling, En passant, Promotion, Checkmate, Mate, Stalemate...
  - menu
  - LAN games
  - ...
