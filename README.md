# PyChess
**PyChess** is a chess application built on **Python** with the **PyGame** library.
It is designed to mirror the game of chess using a computer. This application does not differ from those available on popular chess websites, and the gameplay in it is simple and clear.

## Capabilities and implementations
### The results of my work that I have achieved and implemented in the application are below:


  
  
### Impressions of the game
  - changing the color palette of the chessboard (under 'c' key)
  - the sounds of the execution of the movement and the capture

### User facilities
  - proposed possible moves
  - making the last move visible

### More opportunities coming soon
  - improved pawn promotion to select all allowed pawns (not just queens)
  - stalemate, draw and win scenarios
  - menu
  - LAN games
  - time measurement
  - turn the script into an app
  - ...
